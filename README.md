# Image-Recognition
This repository contains python code for detecting dogs and cats images.
This problem was hosted on Kaggle under the name, cats and dogs redux kernal.
This code is an attempt to understand the process of transfer learning and fine tuning. In this problem I have used 2014 ImageNet competition winners trained model as a root for transfer learning.
This is a part of fast.ai's course on deep learning
